Hi I am sorry I am new I dnt even know how to use it properly.
I have a question on Apparate, its not working for me i am trying to sync hackerrank with github using this syntax 
apparate --repo <nabilashamim/HackerRank> --user <nabila_shamim18> --passwd <7O65$@07EDjnV7Hm> --token <GitHub_Token> 
but what is token ?
and git bash is showing bash: HackerRank: No such file or directory
